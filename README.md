<h1>Project of a Web App that performs predictions based on a machine learning model</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
This project consists of a web app that receives data from a user and returns a message with the diagnosis according to the prediction of a machine learning model of the Random Forest Classifier type. The trained model was serialized and uploaded to the site. Whenever the input values are changed, the forecast is made.

A Random Foresc Classifier model was created and tuned. The overall accuracy achieved was 84.42%
